# Answerfilter
This script is a solution to search for strings among all responses after a questionnaire is filled/closed and the DB (a .csv file) is available. There is a simple, however yet not solved task: define those respondents who mentioned a specific string anywhere among their answers. So filter for these respondents and make a list about these.
